# dash-filter-actions
A Plotly Dash app with Tableau-like filter actions feature.

Filter graphs in the dashboard based on clicked data in other graphs. Maintain the persistence of the filter as you click on more graphs and easily 
spot the active filters with nicely highlighted mark selections. Unfilter easily by clickning on the already selected mark to undo the filtering.
